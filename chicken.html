        <h1>Chicken mix with Veggies and Rice</h1>

        <img src="./images/rice-chicken.jpg" alt="rice and vegetables with chicken, chinese style">
        <p>Chicken fried rice is the comfort dish of Chinese food. It's been around for a very long time and is also common in East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisines</p>
        <p>The addition of oil and soy sauce and veggies and meat spruce up the rice for a delicious meal.</p> 
        <p>A traditional Chinese fried rice would be made in a wok over high heat, but we've made ours in a cast iron skillet since they are more common in home kitchens.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breasts, boneless and skinless, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
